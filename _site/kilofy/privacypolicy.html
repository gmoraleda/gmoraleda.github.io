  <h1>Hi there! üëã</h1>
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Guillermo</strong>, originally from Barcelona (Spain) and
    currently living in Munich (Germany).
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer with a passion for
    <strong>mobile development</strong> and a strong background in
    <strong>mobile devops</strong>. I am passionate about building high-quality
    mobile applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.

    <p>
      My bread and butter is Swift and I've been working with it since 2016. I
      also have experience with other languages like Python, Ruby, JS or Bash.

    <p>
      Building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines is one of my favorite things to
      do. I have experience with GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Bitrise. I tend
      to look for developer experience and automation in everything I do.

      My main focus is mobile development, but I also have experience with cloud
