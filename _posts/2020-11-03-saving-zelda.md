title: Saving Zelda again and again
---

I've never been a *gamer*. When I was a child I had a SEGA Master System II and later a SEGA Mega Drive. These where presents from my uncles. My parents kind of allowed it but never encouraged that hobby. Meaning I didn't get any games but the ones that came with the console itself.

At some point the handheld consoles were a thing and I remember visiting a Cash Converter shop and selling my Mega Drive with a couple of controllers and two or three games so that I could buy a Nintendo Game Boy - classic, of course - with the game **The legend of Zelda: Link's awakening**.

And what a disappointment it was. I wasn't able to understand any English so I remember playing till the first dungeon and then getting lost. There was a saved game on that cartridge where Link had most of the weapons. I remember treasuring that saved game and playing it for fun. Still no clue of what was going on in the game. Yet somehow the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULyEY_GjSoA){:target="_blank"} got hot stamped into my brain.
