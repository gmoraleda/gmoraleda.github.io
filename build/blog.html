  <p>When working in a corporate environment, you will easily find yourself building several variances of the same app, targeting different configurations (debug, beta, release), different environments (staging, production) and different versions.</p>

<p>It can be messy if there is no clear way to differentiate them at a glance, i.e. with the app icon, and can potentially lead to situations where testers insert test data into production or try <em>to QA</em> a feature in the wrong app version.</p>

<p>Our first approach at <a href="https://www.cluno.com/en/career/">Cluno</a> was to generate different icons for different versions and include all of them in the assets catalogue. This methods works straightforward but has two problems. First of all, it is not very flexible. The icons needs to be designed, attached...</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2020/01/30/branching-model.html">ðŸŒ³ Branching Model for iOS development. Continuous Integration withÂ Bitrise</a> - <span>30 Jan, 2020</span></h2>
  <p>When I started working at my current company, the setup we had for our iOS platform was hosted completely locally: <strong>Bitbucket Server</strong> for the repo, <strong>Jenkins</strong> as build platform and an own implementation of <strong>Hockeyapp</strong> for the distribution (as far as I understood, from the old days when Hockeyapp was an open source project). All that was run by an external agency (the one who had developed our app).</p>

<p>One of the first tasks I was assigned to was the internalisation of such services in order to become independent and take control of the development cycle.</p>

<p>For hosting the repository we would use <strong>Bitbucket Cloud</strong> and <strong>Hockeyapp</strong> for distribution, but since our company does not host any server at all (our infrastructure runs mostly under the AWS umbrella), taking over the Jenkins implementation as it was, was not an option. <strong>I was in the market for a new cloud CI/CD platform.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/xcblog/olympics-of-top-5-cloud-ios-continuous-integration-servers-fcaa6c79468d">The Olympics of iOS cloud continuous integration servers</a> was a great starting point. Since we are not developing an iOS only app, buddybuild was not considered. After some research, the two finalists were <strong>CircleCI</strong> and <strong>Bitrise</strong>.</p>
