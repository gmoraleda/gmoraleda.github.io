I" <p>I’ve never been a <em>gamer</em>. When I was a child I had a SEGA Master System II and later a SEGA Mega Drive. These where presents from my uncles. My parents kind of allowed it but never encouraged that hobby. Meaning I didn’t get any games but the ones that came with the console itself.</p>

There was a saved game on that cartridge where Link had most of the weapons. I remember treasuring that saved game and playing it for fun. Still no clue of what was going on in the game.
