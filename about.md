This is Guillermo. Or *Gui*, as the spanish phonetics of my name seem a bit tricky to my German friends. I was born in Barcelona but I've been living in Munich ðŸ¥¨ since 2014... and during this time I've become some sort of [Ã¼ber-German](http://multicoolty.com/25-signs-you-have-been-living-in-germany-for-too-long-and-have-become-a-little-bit-german/){:target="_blank"}.

I write code for a living. Mainly Swift for iOS devices. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gmoraleda_){:target="_blank"}.

This site has been built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), uses the theme [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and is public on [GitHub](https://github.com/gmoraleda/moraleda.info).
