# Personal Site Notes

## Lead-generation refresh (February 2026)

This update repositions the homepage for freelance iOS platform work.

### What changed
- Hero headline and summary now emphasize senior iOS platform ownership and clear contact paths.
- Primary CTA links are above the fold: email, LinkedIn, and Download CV.
- Projects were rewritten to focus on impact and ownership (architecture, offline-first, accessibility, CI/CD) across 5 selected items.
- Added a concise capabilities section with AWS/CDK positioned as a supporting capability.
- Added location/status line: currently based in Munich, open to remote-first projects.
- Added SEO basics: improved page title/description, canonical link, and Open Graph/Twitter tags.
- Removed heavy particle background dependency and simplified frontend JS for better performance.
