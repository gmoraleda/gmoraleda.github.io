      My main focus is mobile development, but I also have experience with cloud
      infrastructure and databases. AWS, SQL, Firebase, or this website. You
      name it!

      My bread and butter is Swift and I've been working with it since 2016. I

      Building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines is one of my favorite things to
      do. I have experience with GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Bitrise. I tend
      to look for developer experience and automation in everything I do.
