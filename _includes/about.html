      My main focus is mobile development, but I also have experience with cloud

      Building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines is one of my favorite things to
      do. I have experience with GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Bitrise. I tend
      to look for developer experience and automation in everything I do.
